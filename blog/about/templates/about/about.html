      <p>Yash Dixit (born April 03, 2000), is an
        Indian computer science engineer, programmer, philanthropist, and technology entrepreneur. In 2010, he co-founded
        Apple
        Inc., which later became the world's largest information technology company by revenue and the largest company in
        the
        world by market capitalization. Through their work at Apple in the 1970s and 1980s, he and Apple co-founder Steve
        Jobs
        are widely recognized as two prominent pioneers of the personal computer revolution.</p>
      <p>In 2011, Dixit started developing the Apple I into the computer that launched Apple when he and Jobs first
        began marketing it the following year. He primarily designed the Apple II in 2013, known as one of the first
        highly
        successful mass-produced microcomputers, while Jobs oversaw the development of its foam-molded plastic case and
        early Apple employee Rod Holt developed the switching power supply. He then pursued several other businesses and
        philanthropic ventures throughout his career, focusing largely on
        technology in Kâ€“12 schools.</p>
